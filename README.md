NEOVIM CONFIG

LAZY NVIM PLUGIN MANAGER

SEVERAL PLUGINS
COLORS
HARPOON
LSP
TELESCOPE
TREESITTER
TOURBLE
UNDOTREE


Update: I don't really use neovim anymore so things might not be updated or whatever and I am not using any of the newer plugins. I also have no dotfiles because I refuse to waste my time configuring my desktop rather than actually programming. I have already wasted so much time language cycling.
